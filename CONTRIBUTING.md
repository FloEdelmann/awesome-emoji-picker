### Coding guidelines

* [editorconfig file](.editorconfig)

**Attention:** For this add-on, you need to execute [`scripts/downloadEmojiImages.sh`](scripts/downloadEmojiImages.sh) to download the bundled emoji sheets if you use anything else than the "native emojis" ("emojis from your OS") in the settings of this add-on. The reason is just, that these big files are not bundled/distributed in this repo.

### Tests

* Test dir: [`src/tests/`](src/tests/)
* EsLint config for tests: [`src/tests/.eslintrc`](src/tests/.eslintrc)
