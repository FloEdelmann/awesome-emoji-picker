### Translating emoji terms (categories, skin names etc.)

**Big tip** for translators: If you translate the `emojiMart*` entries, notice that you will likely find correct translations somewhere for these specific emoji terms.

Actually, it's standardized, because emojis are also standardized. It's Unicode, after all!

So the point to look for correct translations is the Unicode [Common Locale Data Repository](http://cldr.unicode.org/) (**CLDR**, see [their Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Locale_Data_Repository)). You can download the data there and then try to find the correct term. (I did that, and I know it's hard to find, but yes, it must be somewhere in there!)

You can also try to use [the survey tool](https://st.unicode.org/cldr-apps/v#locales///) and look in the section ‚ÄúCharacters‚Äù:

![sidebar: after units, there is an entry called characters, with sub-entries like category, smileys and emojis etc.](./assets/l10n-help-cldr-survey-tool-emojis.png)

Related:
* [discussion at emoji-mart of whether to bundle the translations inside of the library](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart/issues/303)
* [same discussion for their upstream project emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data/issues/148)

## Coding guidelines

* [editorconfig file](.editorconfig)

**Attention:** For this add-on, you need to execute [`scripts/downloadEmojiImages.sh`](scripts/downloadEmojiImages.sh) to download the bundled emoji sheets if you use anything else than the "native emojis" ("emojis from your OS") in the settings of this add-on. The reason is just, that these big files are not bundled/distributed in this repo.

### Tests

* Test dir: [`src/tests/`](src/tests/)
* EsLint config for tests: [`src/tests/.eslintrc`](src/tests/.eslintrc)
