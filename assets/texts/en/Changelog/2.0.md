* **Highlight:** Many new emojis are now supported!🥳 The support now includes [Emoji v12.1](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-12.1/), [Emoji v12.0](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-12.0/) and [Emoji 11.0](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-11.0/)! 🥰🥱👩‍🦽🦧🦦🦾🦘🏴‍☠️ ([#34](https://github.com/rugk/awesome-emoji-picker/issues/34))
* **Removed:** As part of adding support for the new emojis, some emoji sets had to be removed. This includes „Facebook Messenger”, which now belongs to „Facebook” and „EmojiOne” (JoyPixels), which has been removed due to legal problems. If you have chosen one of these designs, they are automatically switched to a similar one. (see [#83](https://github.com/rugk/awesome-emoji-picker/issues/83#issuecomment-601781914) for more details)
* **Improved:** The emoji picker display in special circumstances has been improved, especially when it is shown in Firefox' overflow menu or on Android. ([#72](https://github.com/rugk/awesome-emoji-picker/issues/72))
* **Fixed:** Bug that icon was only displayed in the monochrome version. ([#75](https://github.com/rugk/awesome-emoji-picker/issues/75))
* **Fixed:** Other minor bug fixes.
* **Internal:** Dependencies were updated to ensure the security and reliability of this add-on.
